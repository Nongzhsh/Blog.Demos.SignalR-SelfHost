# Blog.Demos.SignalR-SelfHost
This is a demo project for my [SignalR Self Hosted](https://blog.rniemand.com/signalr-self-hosted/) blog post, why not check it out.

This is  a simplified version [of this post](http://www.asp.net/signalr/overview/deployment/tutorial-signalr-self-host#server) with updated code to run with the newer version of SignalR.

I am open to any feedback, or corrections should you find anything wrong with my post.

Cheers
